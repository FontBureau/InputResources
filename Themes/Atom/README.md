Responsive Atom Stylesheet
==========================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FontBureau/InputResources/master/Themes/Atom/sample.png" />

This is a sample stylesheet using the Input font family, available at <http://input.fontbureau.com>. It uses lot of Less variables and a custom font family structure so it is easy to customize. It is responsive, so you get a narrower font as the window gets narrower.
