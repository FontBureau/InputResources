Responsive Atom Stylesheet
==========================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FontBureau/InputResources/master/Themes/Atom/sample.png" />

This is a sample stylesheet using Input. Using media queries, you get a narrower font as the window gets narrower.

It uses @font-face to create a custom structure for the family, and tries to take advantage of LESS variables so that it is easy to change parameters.
